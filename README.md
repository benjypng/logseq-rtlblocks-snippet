# Instructions

2. Restart your desktop app and your RTL languages should be automatically rendered correctly.
3. For mobile, ensure that your `custom.js` file has been synced successfully by checking your mobile's files app.
4. Once sync-ed, restart your Logseq app and RTL languages should be rendered correctly as well.
