# Overview

This plugin allows a single block to be defined as either right-to-left (RTL) or left-to-right (LTR). This is useful if you need to alternate between typing in both scripts.

# Instructions

1. Use `r r` to toggle between right to left, or left to right modes.
2. In left to right mode, usage is as per normal.
3. In right to left mode, typing will be from right to left, e.g. for Arabic languages.

# Installation

If not available from the marketplace, download the latest release and install it manually in Logseq.
